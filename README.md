# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION
With the increasing use of mobile messaging, spam messages have become a significant problem, leading to potential scams and security threats. This SMS Spam Detection project aims to classify text messages as either Spam (unwanted promotional or fraudulent messages) or Ham (legitimate messages) using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The model is trained on the UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which consists of 5,574 labeled SMS messages. The project preprocesses the text data using tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization before applying machine learning algorithms like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and  for support vector machine classification.
Key Features
